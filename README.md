# KAN-HAR
# Human Activity Recognition using Kolmogorov–Arnold Network (KAN)

This repository provides an open-source implementation of **Human Activity Recognition (HAR)** using a **single three-axis accelerometer** and the **Kolmogorov–Arnold Network (KAN)**. The framework leverages the KAN's ability to model complex nonlinear relationships efficiently, providing competitive performance while maintaining interpretability and a reduced parameter count.

## Features

- Efficient HAR using a **single three-axis accelerometer**.
- Utilizes **KAN** for feature learning and classification.
- Works with **MotionSense dataset** (smartphone-based motion sensor signals).
- Preprocessing and normalization of accelerometer and gyroscope data.
- Competitive or superior classification performance compared to conventional deep neural networks.
- Reduced model parameter count for efficient real-world deployment.

## Dataset

The experiments use the **MotionSense dataset**, which contains smartphone-based motion sensor signals for various physical activities, such as walking, jogging, upstairs, downstairs, sitting, and standing.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BahMoh/KAN-HAR.git
cd KAN-HAR
